# Welcome to the Rx entry simulator

This web app is a mock design of walgreens intercom plus prescription entry window
The purpose of this application is to design a way to reinforce training for
pharmacy technicians and pharmacy typists

## what you will expect

Just as if you were on the job. You are expected to type F1's and calculate the appropiate day supply
Calculations will be done manually for the day supply and most of the items are already pre populated
just like in Walgreens IC+ 

As general practice please complete the tasks as if you were on the job. Type F1's accordingly, calculate the day supply
with the correct prescriber information and submit with the patients insurance plan(If they have any)


## This program is designed for desktops only. It is never designed for a mobile device

Recommended resolution is 1920x1080
I cannot gurantee that anything less than that will display correctly
