# Welcome to the Rx Entry Simulator

This web app is a mock design of walgreens intercom plus prescription entry window
The purpose of this application is to reinforce training for pharmacy technicians and pharmacy typists

## Current state of the project:
https://icplus-rx-simulator.netlify.app/

## what you will expect

Just as if you were on the job, you are expected to type F1s and calculate the appropriate day supply
Calculations will be done manually for the day supply and most items are already pre-populated just like in Walgreens IC+ 

As a general practice, please complete the tasks as if you were on the job. Type F1s accordingly, calculate the day supply with the correct prescriber information, and submit with the patient's insurance plan (if they have any)
